### The presented desktop application is a comprehensive tool supporting effective learning of a selected range of knowledge and skills. The learning process takes place through a combination of techniques improving its course: Pomodoro, flashcards and interactive tasks. Using the Pomodoro timer, the application offers cyclical work and break sessions, but leaves the decision to use them up to the user. The app allows the learner to add their own learning materials using a simple form or importing from files. This allows the lesson to be personalised and allows the learning process to be personalised. In addition, the material entered is saved as a single session so that it is possible to return to a particular session without any problems. The application also has a vocabulary learning module. By implementing a special learning mode, the application offers the mastery of one hundred of the most popular words among the languages available . At the end of each session, the application generates a progress report, providing the user with valuable feedback on the effectiveness of learning. The minimalist interface guarantees an intuitive and simple use of the app, while enriching features such as vocabulary learning with interactive flashcards and interactive tasks are an essential part of the learning process. Flexibility in the choice of learning tools, personalisation and ease of use ensure that the app enhances the user experience, providing an effective tool to support knowledge acquisition.
